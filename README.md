Getting to know bash scripting and unix enviroment.

### rc function for Ilya:

#### Get rc function 

to get rc function for this terminal session:

` source <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karnafun/dotfiles/master/functions/research-clouds.sh) `


#### Usage 

to clone research clouds and configure Web.config
` rc init ` OR ` rc start ` OR ` rc clone ` 
they all do the same thing.

if you want to just configure Web.config
` rc config ` OR `rc web` OR `rc bgroup`
when configuring, make sure you are in the /research-clouds/ folder (and not a subdirectory of it like /research-clouds/assets.html)
